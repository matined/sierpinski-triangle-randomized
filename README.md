# sierpinski-triangle-randomized 
A simple implementation of way to make a Sierpinski triangle or other fractals.

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
You can insert as many points as you want and then the algorithm will randomly create infinitely many points according to these rules:<br>
1. Randomly choose one of the points given by user.<br>
2. Create a point in a half of the distance between this point and the prior one.

<h3>Sierpinski Triangle</h3>
It's one of the most impressive results. If you want to see one insert for instance this set of points: (350, 50), (50, 650), (650, 650) and click 'run'.
